This project is part of the Odin project curriculum.
While building this I learned about authentification and CRUD applications.

This is a forum where anybody can make an account and make posts. However, the author of the posts is anonymous to all but the members of the forum. The members
can see the author of posts, as well as the date that they were posted on.
To become a member, you need to input a secret passcode.

Similarly, admins can edit and delete anybody's posts. To become an admin,
you need to input a secret passcode.
